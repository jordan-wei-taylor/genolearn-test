    genolearn print [NAME]


If ``NAME`` is provided, attempt to print the filename assuming it is in the ``meta`` or ``model`` subdirectories within the current working directory. If ``NAME`` is not provided, print filenames found in ``meta`` and ``model`` subdirectories. If ``NAME`` == 'history', prints the significant commands succesfully executed in the current working directory.
